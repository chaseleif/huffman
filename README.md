Project for Algorithm Design & Analysis

Compress a text file using Huffman encoding.

Compression:
1) Use a minimum heap to order the frequency of characters.
2) Build a binary Huffman tree from the heap
3) Generate encoding based on the tree traversal
4) Record dictionary, generate output
5) Visualize tree
6) Show compression achieved as a percentage

Decompression:
1) Read input
  a) determine dictionary ... show dictionary
  b) expand remaining input according to dictionary
